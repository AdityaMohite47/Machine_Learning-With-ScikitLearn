## Repository for all Machine Learning models I made while learning on Algorithms of Machine Learning...


# Dependencies of the Repository are the following\
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - ScikitLearn
    - Jupyter (either from official source or vs-code extension to run notebooks.)
